# Super-MLG-Bros
A hilarious take on the original Super Mario Bros. 

##How to play
There are a lot of files missing in this repo. Here is the file directory of the original game: 

Assembly-CSharp-vs.csproj
Assembly-CSharp.csproj
Assets/Animations.meta
Assets/Animations/*
Assets/Materials/*
Assets/Prefabs/*
Assets/Resources/Gifs/*
Assets/Resources/Music/*
Assets/Resources/Reactions/*
Assets/Resources/Sounds/*
Assets/Resources/Sprites/*
Assets/Scenes/*
Assets/System.Drawing.dll
Library/*
ProjectSettings/*
Super Mario Bros-csharp.sln
Super Mario Bros-csharp.v12.suo
Super Mario Bros.sln
Super Mario Bros.userprefs
Super Mario Bros.v12.suo

**Some directories shortened for brevity**

The difficult in adding these files to git is that there were too many assets that took up too much space. Instead, it is fairly easy to add new assets. In order to add Gifs to the game modify the GifAnimationDrawer.cs with the name of the gif and add a gif to the Assets/Resources/Gifs directory. 

Adding more resources involves changing the GameManagerScript.
