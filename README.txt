#Info
In order to make this Super Mario Bros. clone, I used the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNuncX98a7M
Much thanks to both Shane DeSeranno for uploading the tutorial and my brother David for explaining to me the complexities of programming this kind of game. 

#To run:
Well because there were so many assets, we could not include them all in our submission. If you would like to see the program in action please use Jonathan's computer for more info. The Scenes and code have been included in a sparse Git repo for your parusal.
